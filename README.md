# Auction Prototype

A React + Vite prototype of an airline upgrade auction experience.

It includes:
- Admin dashboard for auction operations
- Flight list and flight-level bid management
- Global auction rules configuration
- Email template previews (invite, reminder, confirmation)
- Passenger-side bidding flow mockup

This is a front-end prototype with mock data (no backend/API integration yet).

corepack prepare pnpm@11.4.0 --activate
pnpm -v
```

### 1. Install dependencies

- Styling is inline and concentrated in `UpgradeAuctionAdmin.jsx` for rapid prototyping.

## AI-Assisted shadcn Workflow

This repository includes project-level shadcn skills for agent-driven development.

Installed artifacts:
- `.agents/skills/shadcn`
- `skills-lock.json`

Install command used:

```bash
pnpm dlx skills add shadcn/ui
```

Recommended next steps:
1. Initialize shadcn for this app (`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`) so `components.json` is created.
2. Add required components with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
3. Keep generated UI primitives in `src/components/ui` and compose app-specific components separately.
